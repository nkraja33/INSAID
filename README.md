# INSAID Projects

> Each folder in this Repository links to a Project which I completed under GCD Program.

1. **Term1&2 EDA Project** : In this Project i have analayzed a Summer Olympics data provided by INSAID and in that I have analyzed many parameters and found the relations among them. I have used the below libraries from **Python** to complete the project.

      Tools Used:
	  1. **Pandas** -- For Data Processing.
	  2. **Matplotib & Seaborn** -- To Visualize the results.
	  
 For More details please refer `Summer_Olympics_EDA.pptx` file.
	  
2. **Machine Learning Foundation** : In this Project, I have Ames Housing Dataset downladed from Kaggle's Getting Started Competion.
  In this i have applied Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the house of given dataset.
  The Dataset containd 2 files names `train.csv` & `test.csv`. Each has same columns except `SalePrice` column which is not available in `test.csv` file, We have build and train a **Machine Learning** Model with the datas from `train.csv` and we need to the house price for datas in `test.csv` file, I have uses the below tools from **Python** to complete this project.  And provided a high level relation between the parameters in a ppt file.

     Tools Used:
	  1. **Pandas** -- For Data Processing.
	  2. **Matplotib & Seaborn** -- To Visualize the results.
	  3. **Scikit Learn** -- To import the Machine Learning Algorthims
	  
   I have applied the Machine Learning Algorthims to complete this project.
   
      1. **Linera Regression**
      2. **XGBoost**
      3. **Randome Forest(Ensemble)**
