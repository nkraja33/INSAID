# Machine Learning FOundation

**Machine Learning Foundation** : In this Project, I have Ames Housing Dataset downladed from Kaggle's Getting Started Competion.
  In this i have applied Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the house of given dataset.
  The Dataset containd 2 files names `train.csv` & `test.csv`. Each has same columns except `SalePrice` column which is not available in `test.csv` file, We have build and train a **Machine Learning** Model with the datas from `train.csv` and we need to the house price for datas in `test.csv` file, I have uses the below tools from **Python** to complete this project.  And provided a high level relation between the parameters in a ppt file.

     Tools Used:
	  1. **Pandas** -- For Data Processing.
	  2. **Matplotib & Seaborn** -- To Visualize the results.
	  3. **Scikit Learn** -- To import the Machine Learning Algorthims
	  
   I have applied the Machine Learning Algorthims to complete this project.
   
      1. Linera Regression
	  2. XGBoost
	  3. Randome Forest(Ensemble)
